### What does it do and why did I build it?

For my second Milestone project I chose to build a simple yet fun and challenge game using the Phaser engine.

I set out to build a game that was simple in design as well as understanding, so it can be picked up easy by anyone.

Ideally it was build with my two year old nephew in mind as a simple time sink for him when on the road,

So I came up with a game based around other games like temple run and snake, where it would be an endless loop with a difficulty that
would slowly ramp up as the game progressed.

### Functionality of project.

This game was build to be fully respnsive, working both on mobile as well as web brower.

The web brower would work by clicking on the car while the mobile version would work based on touch.

It would be a simple score keeping game that would reset everytime you crashed so you could easily restart and try to beat it.


### UX Design

With a two year old being the main audiences of this game, I went in it with the idea of keeping it as simple and as  clean as possible,
So I went for a real flat minimalist design that would not be overwhelming for anyone to play.

While I testing I found, that the design worked in favour for every age group that played it as they found it simple and easy to understand the idea 
behind the game while also feeling it wasn't overly childish.

The only change made after testing was to add a quick describtion of what to do at the start, as I found it would take one attempt to fully understand you where in
control of both cars.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5 - markup language
- Javascript 
- Phaser 3.23.0
- Images from https://opengameart.org/
- Sounds from Freesounds.org
- GIT
- GITHUB
- Google Chrome developer tools
- Code Snippets from https://williamclarkson.net/
- XAMPP for hosting and testing my game locally 
- Visual Studio Code editor 
- Youtube.com For Phaser tuts
- https://textcraft.net/ - for fonts 

### Testing

Testing for this game was done on my computer using XAMPP local host as a HTTP server to test my game while in development
on my desktop and to test it using a chrome as my brower.

Once it was deploded to GIT it was then tested over many different smartphones and tablets.
Those smartphones being Iphone X, Iphone 8, Ipad mini, One plus 6, Samsung 7, Samsung S 7 edge, One plus 5 as well as Iphone 6

As well as being tested on phone it was also tested on Chrome as well as Safari and FireFox.

The problems I ran into and still could not fix was getting the audio to work as well as having some small grabs between the brower and game on mobile.

Also found out dduring testing that adding a simple insturction at the start screen helps with making it even easier to understand.

### Deployment

- The game was coded using Visual Studio Code
- XAMPP was used for a local version for testing during delopment 
- It was then uploaded to GITHUB using the Terminal inside of VScode and GIt Bash installed on my computer 
- Once uploaded to GitHub it was then hosted on GitPages
