# Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project 2

## I Can't Drive 

### What does it do and why did I build it?

For my second Milestone project I chose to build a simple yet fun and challenge game using the Phaser engine.

I set out to build a game that was simple in design as well as understanding, so it can be picked up easy by anyone.

Ideally it was build with my two year old nephew in mind as a simple time sink for him when on the road,

So I came up with a game based around other games like temple run and snake, where it would be an endless loop with a difficulty that
would slowly ramp up as the game progressed.

### Functionality of project.

This game was build to be fully respnsive, working both on mobile as well as web brower.

The web brower would work by clicking on the car while the moobile version would work based on touch.

It would be a simple score keeping game that would reset everytime you crashed so you could easily restart and try to beat it.




### UX Design

With a two year old being the main audiences of this game, I went in it with the idea of keeping as simple as a clean as possible,
So I went for a real flat minimalist design that would not be overwhelming for anyone to play.

While I testing I found, that the design worked in favour for every age group that played it as they found it simple and east to understand the idea 
behind the game while also feeling it wasn't overly childish.
